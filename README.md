# Full-Text Search Extension

Full-Text Search is an extension to DuckDB that allows for search through strings, similar to [SQLite's FTS5 extension](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html).

## Installing and Loading

The `fts` extension will be transparently autoloaded on first use from the official extension repository.
If you would like to install and load it manually, run:

```sql
INSTALL fts;
LOAD fts;
```

## Usage

The extension adds two `PRAGMA` statements to DuckDB: one to create, and one to drop an index. Additionally, a scalar macro `stem` is added, which is used internally by the extension. Each index schema also contains search macros and an `analyze_text` table macro configured for that index.

### `PRAGMA create_fts_index`

```python
create_fts_index(input_table, input_id, *input_values, stemmer = 'porter',
                 tokenizer = 'regex',
                 stopwords = 'english',
                 ignore = "[0-9!@#$%^&*()_+={}\\[\\]:;<>,.?~\\\\/\\|''\"`-]+",
                 strip_accents = 1, lower = 1, overwrite = 0,
                 incremental = 0, cluster_terms = 0, layered_search = 0)
```

`PRAGMA` that creates a FTS index for the specified table.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD056 -->

| Name | Type | Description |
|:--|:--|:----------|
| `input_table` | `VARCHAR` | Qualified name of specified table, e.g., `'table_name'` or `'main.table_name'` |
| `input_id` | `VARCHAR` | Column name of document identifier, e.g., `'document_identifier'` |
| `input_values…` | `VARCHAR` | Column names of the text fields to be indexed (vararg), e.g., `'text_field_1'`, `'text_field_2'`, ..., `'text_field_N'`, or `'\*'` for all columns in input_table of type `VARCHAR` |
| `stemmer` | `VARCHAR` | The type of stemmer to be used. One of `'arabic'`, `'armenian'`, `'basque'`, `'catalan'`, `'czech'`, `'danish'`, `'dutch'`, `'dutch_porter'`, `'english'`, `'esperanto'`, `'estonian'`, `'finnish'`, `'french'`, `'german'`, `'greek'`, `'hindi'`, `'hungarian'`, `'indonesian'`, `'irish'`, `'italian'`, `'lithuanian'`, `'nepali'`, `'norwegian'`, `'persian'`, `'polish'`, `'porter'`, `'portuguese'`, `'romanian'`, `'russian'`, `'serbian'`, `'sesotho'`, `'spanish'`, `'swedish'`, `'tamil'`, `'turkish'`, `'yiddish'`, or `'none'` if no stemming is to be used. Defaults to `'porter'` |
| `tokenizer` | `VARCHAR` | Tokenizer to use. `'regex'` keeps the legacy regex-split behavior. `'opensearch_standard'` uses an OpenSearch/Lucene standard-tokenizer compatibility mode that splits Han, Hiragana, and Katakana into single-character tokens while preserving word runs for scripts such as Hebrew, Cyrillic, Arabic, Latin, and Hangul. Defaults to `'regex'` |
| `stopwords` | `VARCHAR` | Qualified name of table containing a single `VARCHAR` column containing the desired stopwords, or `'none'` if no stopwords are to be used. Defaults to `'english'` for a pre-defined list of 571 English stopwords |
| `ignore` | `VARCHAR` | Regular expression of patterns to be ignored by the `'regex'` tokenizer. Defaults to a punctuation and digit pattern |
| `strip_accents` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to remove accents (e.g., convert `á` to `a`). Defaults to `1` for `'regex'` and `0` for `'opensearch_standard'`. `strip_accents=true` is not supported with `'opensearch_standard'` because OpenSearch's standard analyzer lowercases tokens but does not strip accents |
| `lower` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to convert all text to lowercase. Defaults to `1` |
| `overwrite` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to overwrite an existing index on a table. Defaults to `0` |
| `incremental` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to maintain the FTS index with triggers after inserts and deletes on the input table. Defaults to `0` |
| `cluster_terms` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to physically order the generated `terms` table by `termid`, `fieldid`, and `docid`. This can improve query-time pruning for direct reads from the FTS tables. Defaults to `0` |
| `layered_search` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to build the dictionary sidecars, positional postings, and layered search macros used by expanded, autocomplete, phrase, phrase-prefix, near, wildcard, and regex queries. This implies `cluster_terms`. Defaults to `0` |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD056 -->

This `PRAGMA` builds the index under a newly created schema. The schema will be named after the input table: if an index is created on table `'main.table_name'`, then the schema will be named `'fts_main_table_name'`.

By default, indexes are static snapshots. If the input table changes after
index creation, rebuild the index with `overwrite = true` or use
`incremental = true` when creating the index. Incremental indexes are maintained
with triggers for `INSERT` and `DELETE` statements. They require trigger
support, a document id column declared `NOT NULL` or `PRIMARY KEY`, and unique
document id values. Persistent databases must use storage version `v2.0.0` or
newer for incremental indexes.

`cluster_terms = true` changes only the physical ordering of the generated
`terms` table. For incremental indexes, the initial index build uses the
clustered layout, but trigger-appended rows are not globally reclustered.

### `PRAGMA drop_fts_index`

```python
drop_fts_index(input_table)
```

Drops a FTS index for the specified table. This removes the generated FTS
schema and any triggers used for incremental maintenance. Recreating an index
with `overwrite = true` performs the same cleanup before building the new index.


| Name | Type | Description |
|:--|:--|:-----------|
| `input_table` | `VARCHAR` | Qualified name of input table, e.g., `'table_name'` or `'main.table_name'` |

### Analyzer Inspection

Every generated FTS schema exposes the analyzer used by that index as a table
macro:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM fts_main_documents.analyze_text('The running foxes')
ORDER BY position;
```

The result contains the normalized unstemmed `raw_term`, final indexed `term`,
one-based absolute `position`, `position_increment`, `position_length`,
`start_offset`, `end_offset`, and `token_type`. Empty tokenizer output is
removed before positions are assigned. Stopwords are removed afterward, so
leading and internal stopwords remain visible as position gaps.

Current analyzers use a position length of one and the token type `word`.
Offsets are reserved as nullable, half-open, zero-based UTF-8 byte offsets into
the original input. They are currently `NULL` because normalization prevents
the regex and OpenSearch-compatible tokenizers from mapping every token
reliably back to the original string.

`analyze_text` uses the same generated analyzer definition as bulk indexing,
incremental maintenance, and query analysis. The lower-level list-returning
`tokenize` macro remains available for compatibility, but it does not apply
stopword removal or stemming. Analyzer contract changes are versioned in
`index_metadata` and require dropping and recreating an existing index.

### `match_bm25` Function

```python
match_bm25(input_id, query_string, fields := NULL, k := 1.2, b := 0.75,
           conjunctive := 0, field_weights := NULL, field_b := NULL,
           scoring_model := 'bm25f', tie_breaker := 0.0)
```

When an index is built, this retrieval macro is created that can be used to search the index.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:--|:--|:----------|
| `input_id` | `VARCHAR` | Column name of document identifier, e.g., `'document_identifier'` |
| `query_string` | `VARCHAR` | The string to search the index for |
| `fields` | `VARCHAR` | Comma-separated list of fields to search in, e.g., `'text_field_2, text_field_N'`. Defaults to `NULL` to search all indexed fields |
| `k` | `DOUBLE` | Parameter _k<sub>1</sub>_ in the Okapi BM25 retrieval model. Defaults to `1.2` |
| `b` | `DOUBLE` | Parameter _b_ in the Okapi BM25 retrieval model. Defaults to `0.75` |
| `conjunctive` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to make the query conjunctive, i.e., all query terms that remain after tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming must be present for a document to be retrieved |
| `field_weights` | `MAP(VARCHAR, DOUBLE)` | Non-negative finite weights for indexed fields. Omitted fields have weight `1.0`. Defaults to `NULL` |
| `field_b` | `MAP(VARCHAR, DOUBLE)` | Per-field BM25 length-normalization parameters. Values must be between `0.0` and `1.0`; omitted fields inherit `b`. Defaults to `NULL` |
| `scoring_model` | `VARCHAR` | Field scoring model: `bm25f` or `best_fields`. Defaults to `bm25f` |
| `tie_breaker` | `DOUBLE` | Contribution from non-best fields in `best_fields` mode. Must be finite and between `0.0` and `1.0`. Defaults to `0.0` |

BM25F is the default for both single-field and multi-field indexes. It
normalizes term frequency independently for each selected field, combines those
frequencies using `field_weights`, and applies BM25 saturation once. A
single-field index reduces to ordinary BM25. Existing multi-field indexes may
produce different scores and ordering after rebuilding with this version.

### Layered BM25 Search

```python
search_layered_bm25(query_string, fields := NULL, top_k := 50, k := 1.2,
                    b := 0.75, term_limit := 32, max_df_ratio := 0.15,
                    max_df := 50000, enable_prefix := true,
                    enable_substring := true, enable_fuzzy := true,
                    enable_short_fuzzy := true, expand_exact_terms := false,
                    query_mode := 'standard', field_weights := NULL,
                    field_b := NULL, scoring_model := 'bm25f',
                    tie_breaker := 0.0)

match_layered_bm25(input_id, query_string, fields := NULL, k := 1.2,
                   b := 0.75, term_limit := 32, max_df_ratio := 0.15,
                   max_df := 50000, enable_prefix := true,
                   enable_substring := true, enable_fuzzy := true,
                   enable_short_fuzzy := true, expand_exact_terms := false,
                   query_mode := 'standard', field_weights := NULL,
                   field_b := NULL, scoring_model := 'bm25f',
                   tie_breaker := 0.0)
```

When `layered_search` is enabled, the extension builds dictionary sidecar
tables used to expand query terms before scoring over the standard FTS `terms`
table. These sidecar tables grow with the term dictionary rather than with the
document corpus.

`search_layered_bm25` is a table macro returning `docname`, `score`, and
`rank`. `match_layered_bm25` is the scalar form for use against an input table
row. Both macros use the same tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, field
filtering, and BM25 parameters as the base FTS index.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD056 -->

| Name | Type | Description |
|:--|:--|:----------|
| `input_id` | `VARCHAR` | Document identifier to score. Only used by `match_layered_bm25` |
| `query_string` | `VARCHAR` | The string to search the index for |
| `fields` | `VARCHAR` | Comma-separated list of indexed fields to search. Defaults to `NULL` to search all indexed fields |
| `top_k` | `BIGINT` | Maximum number of rows returned by `search_layered_bm25`. Defaults to `50`; use `NULL` to return all matches |
| `k` | `DOUBLE` | Parameter _k<sub>1</sub>_ in the Okapi BM25 retrieval model. Defaults to `1.2` |
| `b` | `DOUBLE` | Parameter _b_ in the Okapi BM25 retrieval model. Defaults to `0.75` |
| `term_limit` | `BIGINT` | Maximum number of expanded alternatives to include per query term. Defaults to `32` |
| `max_df_ratio` | `DOUBLE` | Maximum document-frequency ratio for terms considered during expansion. Defaults to `0.15` |
| `max_df` | `BIGINT` | Absolute document-frequency cap for terms considered during expansion. Defaults to `50000` |
| `enable_prefix` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to include dictionary terms that start with a query term. Defaults to `true` |
| `enable_substring` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to include dictionary terms that contain a query term. Defaults to `true` |
| `enable_fuzzy` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to include Damerau-Levenshtein fuzzy alternatives. Defaults to `true` |
| `enable_short_fuzzy` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to use a length-clustered path for short fuzzy alternatives. Defaults to `true` |
| `expand_exact_terms` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether to also expand a query term that already has an exact dictionary match. Defaults to `false` |
| `near_distance` | `BIGINT` | Tokens permitted between the first and the last query term in `near` mode, ignored otherwise. Must be a non-negative integer. Counted once across the whole match, and intervening query terms count toward it. `0` means the terms are consecutive. This is `NEAR` `N` from SQLite's FTS5, and shares its default of `10` |
| `query_mode` | `VARCHAR` | Query execution mode. `standard` uses exact, prefix, substring, and fuzzy dictionary expansion; `autocomplete` keeps preceding tokens exact and matches the final token by raw-token prefix; `phrase` requires exact order and adjacency; `phrase_prefix` treats the final phrase token as a raw-token prefix; `near` requires every term in one field within `near_distance` tokens of each other, in any order; `wildcard` matches `*` and `?` patterns; `regex` matches a conservative flat RE2 subset. Defaults to `standard` |
| `field_weights` | `MAP(VARCHAR, DOUBLE)` | Non-negative finite weights for indexed fields. Omitted fields have weight `1.0`. Defaults to `NULL` |
| `field_b` | `MAP(VARCHAR, DOUBLE)` | Per-field BM25 length-normalization parameters. Values must be between `0.0` and `1.0`; omitted fields inherit `b`. Defaults to `NULL` |
| `scoring_model` | `VARCHAR` | Field scoring model: `bm25f` or `best_fields`. Defaults to `bm25f` |
| `tie_breaker` | `DOUBLE` | Contribution from non-best fields in `best_fields` mode. Must be finite and between `0.0` and `1.0`. Defaults to `0.0` |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD056 -->

Exact terms are always included in the candidate set. Prefix, substring, and
fuzzy alternatives are optional and receive lower expansion weights before BM25
scoring. Numeric query terms are searched exactly and are excluded from
trigram/fuzzy expansion. Stopwords are removed before both exact matching and
expansion, so a query containing only stopwords returns no rows.

In `bm25f` mode, each field term frequency is divided by its field-specific
length normalization. The weighted normalized frequencies are summed into a
pseudo-frequency before BM25 saturation is applied once. In `best_fields` mode,
each field is saturated and scored separately, then combined as
`max(field_score) + tie_breaker * (sum(field_score) - max(field_score))`.
IDF remains corpus-wide for both models. Unknown fields and invalid models,
weights, normalization values, or tie breakers produce an error. A nonzero tie
breaker is only valid with `best_fields`.

Autocomplete mode requires a final searchable token of at least two characters.
It routes that token through a compact two/three-character prefix table and
then verifies the full raw-token prefix. The existing postings table stores a
raw-token identifier alongside each stemmed term, so autocomplete remains
correct when multiple raw forms share a stem. It does not use substring or
fuzzy expansion for the final token.

Phrase mode uses positional postings to require zero-slop matches in one
indexed field. Positions are assigned after empty tokenizer output is removed
and before stopword removal, so removed stopwords retain their positional gap.
Phrase-prefix mode applies the same positional check but expands only the final
unfinished raw token through the prefix sidecar. `term_limit` bounds those
deterministically ordered completions; document-frequency filters and fuzzy or
substring expansion are not applied. A one-token phrase uses standard mode,
while a one-token phrase-prefix uses autocomplete mode.

Near mode uses the same positional postings to require that every query term
occurs in one indexed field, in any order, with at most `near_distance` tokens
between the first and the last of them. The distance is counted once across the
whole match rather than for each pair, and intervening query terms count toward
it, so two terms need `near_distance = 0` to be adjacent while three consecutive
terms need `1`. As in phrase mode, removed stopwords retain their positional gap, so a
stopword between two terms consumes distance. A term repeated in the query
counts once, and quoted phrases are not supported; the query is a set of
distinct terms. Near mode matches exact dictionary terms, so prefix, fuzzy, and
substring expansion are not applied, and a term that occurs in no document
disqualifies every document. `near_distance` is `NEAR` `N` from SQLite's FTS5
and shares its default of `10`.

Wildcard and regex modes treat the complete `query_string` as one whole-token
pattern and match it verbatim against the normalized raw-term dictionary.
Wildcard syntax supports `*`, `?`, and backslash escaping. Regex syntax is a
flat RE2 subset containing literals, escaped non-alphanumeric literals, `.`,
character classes, and `*`, `+`, `?`, or bounded repetition quantifiers. Groups,
alternation, anchors, inline flags, and character-class escapes are rejected.
The bounded native pattern analyzer validates this grammar and extracts one
mandatory literal. Candidate generation, dictionary verification, field
deduplication, and scoring remain relational SQL operations.

An indexable pattern must contain either an unquantified leading literal prefix
of at least two characters or another mandatory literal run of at least three
characters. Leading prefixes use the existing prefix sidecar; internal literals
intersect the normalized-term trigram index plus a sparse, deduplicated sidecar
for raw forms not covered by it. Candidates are then verified with
`regexp_full_match`, so sidecar lookup cannot introduce false matches.
Pattern modes ignore `term_limit` and document-frequency expansion limits.

Pattern clauses use constant scoring: every matching document field contributes
once, regardless of token frequency or the number of matching raw terms. BM25F
sums matching field weights. `best_fields` applies its normal tie-breaker formula
to those field weights. BM25 length normalization and IDF do not apply to
pattern clauses. Because pattern text is not passed through the index's text
analyzer at query time, callers must use the normalized spelling; for example,
a lowercase index does not lowercase an uppercase wildcard pattern
automatically.

Structured Boolean queries evaluate all pattern leaves together through the
same indexed paths, carrying each leaf's node ID through candidate generation
and scoring. Ordinary leaves continue to use the non-pattern layered core, so
an unused pattern branch does not add a correlated search plan per leaf.

Layered search can be static or incremental. With `layered_search = true` and
`incremental = false`, the sidecar tables are built once and later table
changes are not visible until the index is rebuilt. With both options enabled,
the sidecar tables are maintained together with the base FTS index for
`INSERT` and `DELETE`.

Indexes store a compact field-length list on each document row and corpus
average lengths in the statistics row. Layered indexes additionally store a
one-based position on every posting. The `index_metadata` view records the
physical format version, enabled features, indexed fields, and analyzer
fingerprint. The fingerprint includes a canonical digest of the effective
stopword set; the separate `stopwords` column retains its configured source
for provenance. Existing indexes created by an older extension version must
be dropped and rebuilt before field-aware or positional scoring can be used.

### Structured Boolean Layered Search

```python
search_layered_bm25_query(query, top_k := 50, k := 1.2, b := 0.75,
                          term_limit := 32, max_df_ratio := 0.15,
                          max_df := 50000, enable_prefix := true,
                          enable_substring := true, enable_fuzzy := true,
                          enable_short_fuzzy := true,
                          expand_exact_terms := false,
                          field_weights := NULL, field_b := NULL,
                          scoring_model := 'bm25f', tie_breaker := 0.0,
                          max_leaf_clauses := 1024,
                          max_boolean_depth := 64)

match_layered_bm25_query(input_id, query, k := 1.2, b := 0.75,
                         term_limit := 32, max_df_ratio := 0.15,
                         max_df := 50000, enable_prefix := true,
                         enable_substring := true, enable_fuzzy := true,
                         enable_short_fuzzy := true,
                         expand_exact_terms := false,
                         field_weights := NULL, field_b := NULL,
                         scoring_model := 'bm25f', tie_breaker := 0.0,
                         max_leaf_clauses := 1024,
                         max_boolean_depth := 64)
```

These macros accept a JSON query tree. Load DuckDB's `json` extension before
creating a layered index to install the structured macros together with the
index. For a layered index that already exists, or one created before `json`
was loaded, load `json` and run
`PRAGMA create_fts_boolean_query_macros('table_name')`; this installs only the
macros and does not rebuild the index. A node is either a leaf with `query` or a
Boolean group containing `must`, `should`, and `must_not` arrays:

```sql
LOAD json;

SELECT docname, score, rank
FROM fts_main_animal_sounds.search_layered_bm25_query(
    '{
        "must": [
            {"query": "quack", "fields": ["text_content"]}
        ],
        "should": [
            {
                "query": "han",
                "fields": ["author"],
                "query_mode": "autocomplete",
                "boost": 2.0
            }
        ],
        "must_not": [
            {"query": "archive"}
        ],
        "minimum_should_match": 0
    }'::JSON,
    top_k := 10
);
```

Every `must` clause must match and any matching `must_not` clause excludes the
document. A should-only group requires one matching clause by default; a group
with at least one `must` clause defaults to zero. An explicit
`minimum_should_match` counts direct `should` children. Positive child scores
are added and then multiplied by the group's optional `boost`. Leaf boosts are
applied to the leaf BM25 score first.

Leaves can select indexed fields with a JSON string array and choose
`standard`, `autocomplete`, `phrase`, `phrase_prefix`, `near`, `wildcard`, or
`regex` query mode independently. A `near` leaf takes its own optional
`near_distance`, so one clause can require proximity while another does not.
Expansion controls and field scoring configuration remain macro-level settings
so all leaves share the same resource limits and field model.
`scoring_model := 'bm25f'` uses canonical BM25F with optional
`field_weights` and per-field length normalization through `field_b`;
`best_fields` selects the strongest field and optionally incorporates the
others through `tie_breaker`. Ordinary leaves reuse the non-pattern layered
core, while wildcard and regex leaves share one set-oriented indexed pattern
pipeline. The Boolean layer combines the resulting scores over the same
layered index.

By default, query trees are limited to 1,024 leaves and a maximum Boolean depth
of 64. Callers can lower or raise these resource limits with
`max_leaf_clauses` and `max_boolean_depth`; passing `NULL` disables the
corresponding extension-level limit. The Boolean tree is evaluated recursively,
so these are resource controls rather than fixed SQL-plan limits. Empty groups,
pure-negative groups, unknown keys, mixed leaf/group nodes, invalid boosts, and
out-of-range `minimum_should_match` values are rejected. Setting
`minimum_should_match` explicitly to zero on a should-only group matches all
indexed documents; documents that match no optional leaf receive score `0`.

### `stem` Function

```python
stem(input_string, stemmer)
```

Reduces words to their base. Used internally by the extension.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:--|:--|:----------|
| `input_string` | `VARCHAR` | The column or constant to be stemmed. |
| `stemmer` | `VARCHAR` | The type of stemmer to be used. One of `'arabic'`, `'armenian'`, `'basque'`, `'catalan'`, `'czech'`, `'danish'`, `'dutch'`, `'dutch_porter'`, `'english'`, `'esperanto'`, `'estonian'`, `'finnish'`, `'french'`, `'german'`, `'greek'`, `'hindi'`, `'hungarian'`, `'indonesian'`, `'irish'`, `'italian'`, `'lithuanian'`, `'nepali'`, `'norwegian'`, `'persian'`, `'polish'`, `'porter'`, `'portuguese'`, `'romanian'`, `'russian'`, `'serbian'`, `'sesotho'`, `'spanish'`, `'swedish'`, `'tamil'`, `'turkish'`, `'yiddish'`, or `'none'` if no stemming is to be used. |

## Example Usage

Create a table and fill it with text data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    document_identifier VARCHAR,
    text_content VARCHAR,
    author VARCHAR,
    doc_version INTEGER
);
INSERT INTO documents
    VALUES ('doc1',
            'The mallard is a dabbling duck that breeds throughout the temperate.',
            'Hannes Mühleisen',
            3),
           ('doc2',
            'The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.',
            'Laurens Kuiper',
            2
           );
```

Build the index, and make both the `text_content` and `author` columns searchable.

```sql
PRAGMA create_fts_index(
    'documents', 'document_identifier', 'text_content', 'author'
);
```

Search the `author` field index for documents that are authored by `Muhleisen`. This retrieves `doc1`:

```sql
SELECT document_identifier, text_content, score
FROM (
    SELECT *, fts_main_documents.match_bm25(
        document_identifier,
        'Muhleisen',
        fields := 'author'
    ) AS score
    FROM documents
) sq
WHERE score IS NOT NULL
  AND doc_version > 2
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

| document_identifier |                             text_content                             | score |

Search for documents about `small cats`. This retrieves `doc2`:

```sql
SELECT document_identifier, text_content, score
FROM (
    SELECT *, fts_main_documents.match_bm25(
        document_identifier,
        'small cats'
    ) AS score
    FROM documents
) sq
WHERE score IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

| document_identifier |                        text_content                        | score |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------:|
| doc2                | The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. | 0.0   |

Build an incremental index when inserts and deletes should update the index
automatically. The document identifier must be non-null and unique:

```sql
CREATE TABLE live_documents (
    document_identifier VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    text_content VARCHAR
);

INSERT INTO live_documents
    VALUES ('doc1', 'quacking quacking'),
           ('doc2', 'barking barking');

PRAGMA create_fts_index(
    'live_documents',
    'document_identifier',
    'text_content',
    incremental = true
);

INSERT INTO live_documents VALUES ('doc3', 'meowing');

SELECT document_identifier
FROM (
    SELECT *, fts_main_live_documents.match_bm25(
        document_identifier,
        'meowing'
    ) AS score
    FROM live_documents
) sq
WHERE score IS NOT NULL;
```

Use layered search when query terms should match exact terms plus prefix,
substring, or typo-tolerant alternatives:

```sql
CREATE TABLE animal_sounds (
    document_identifier VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    text_content VARCHAR,
    author VARCHAR
);

INSERT INTO animal_sounds
    VALUES ('doc1', 'quacking quacking', 'Hannes'),
           ('doc2', 'barking barking', 'Mark'),
           ('doc3', 'meowing meowing', 'Laurens');

PRAGMA create_fts_index(
    'animal_sounds',
    'document_identifier',
    'text_content',
    'author',
    stemmer = 'none',
    stopwords = 'none',
    layered_search = true,
    incremental = true
);

SELECT docname, score, rank
FROM fts_main_animal_sounds.search_layered_bm25(
    'quack',
    fields := 'text_content',
    top_k := 10
);
```

Weight fields independently, or prefer the strongest matching field while
retaining a fraction of the remaining field scores:

```sql
SELECT docname, score, rank
FROM fts_main_animal_sounds.search_layered_bm25(
    'mark',
    field_weights := MAP {
        'author': 4.0,
        'text_content': 1.0
    },
    field_b := MAP {'author': 0.3, 'text_content': 0.8},
    scoring_model := 'best_fields',
    tie_breaker := 0.1,
    top_k := 10
);
```

The scalar layered helper can be used in the same row-filtering pattern as
`match_bm25`:

```sql
SELECT document_identifier, text_content, score
FROM (
    SELECT *, fts_main_animal_sounds.match_layered_bm25(
        document_identifier,
        'mark',
        fields := 'author',
        enable_short_fuzzy := false
    ) AS score
    FROM animal_sounds
) sq
WHERE score IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

By default, exact dictionary matches are not further expanded. Set
`expand_exact_terms := true` to include alternatives for exact query terms:

```sql
SELECT docname
FROM fts_main_animal_sounds.search_layered_bm25(
    'mark',
    fields := 'author',
    expand_exact_terms := true
);
```

For low-latency term-prefix search, use autocomplete mode. Earlier tokens are
matched exactly after the configured stemming, while only the final token is
treated as a raw prefix:

```sql
SELECT docname, score, rank
FROM fts_main_animal_sounds.search_layered_bm25(
    'han quac',
    fields := 'text_content,author',
    query_mode := 'autocomplete',
    top_k := 10
);
```

Use phrase mode for exact adjacency and phrase-prefix mode when the final token
is still being typed:

```sql
SELECT docname, score, rank
FROM fts_main_animal_sounds.search_layered_bm25(
    'quacking quacking',
    fields := 'text_content',
    query_mode := 'phrase',
    top_k := 10
);

SELECT docname, score, rank
FROM fts_main_animal_sounds.search_layered_bm25(
    'quacking quac',
    fields := 'text_content',
    query_mode := 'phrase_prefix',
    top_k := 10
);
```

## Stemmers

The extension bundles the [Snowball](https://snowballstem.org/) stemming
library (vendored under `third_party/snowball/`).

Starting with the upgrade to Snowball v3, the previously available
`'german2'` and `'kraaij_pohlmann'` stemmers (legacy variants that were
undocumented but accepted by the underlying library) have been removed
upstream. If you relied on them, rebuild the FTS index with one of the
documented stemmers instead.
